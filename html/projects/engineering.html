              At Stanislaus State University, 
              I had the opportunity to work with a team of seven Software Engineers to deploy a Team Management web application. 
              Under an agile methodology, we worked within for four months to demonstrate and deliver a product to our advisor. 
              I was able to help organize the team to meet frequently to discuss product design, code reviews, unit-testing, and deployment plans. 
              And to ensure software maintenance and prospective scalibility, 
              we wrote a comprehensive documentation of the development to instruct further developers on codebase usage.

              At Stanislaus State University, 
              I worked with two talented Data Engineers to develop a low-latency system for organizing more than 10,000 books. 
              During the six month endeavor, 
              we designed a hashing algorithm capable of searching for any book within a dataset of 10,000 in under 0.2ms.

              In collaboration with my Data Engineers, 
              we have taken care of the optimization of locating books, 
              so we made sure to also take care of the optimization of getting to that feature. 
              The database menu features an optimized GUI to increase navigational speed.

              In May 2022, I had the opportunity to meet an industry Software Engineer working at Palo Alto Networks. 
              And after mentions of looking for a financial management application, 
              we have decided to take its development into our own hands. 
              Thus, Wifinance, a web application for making financial management easier, was born.

              Given my experience of user interface development, 
              I was delegated the tasks of building the infrastructure of the application. 
              Employing frontend technologies, 
              I designed and developed a simple and easy-to-navigate web application to connect the user with the backend logic and database.
