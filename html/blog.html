            I think starting a blog to jot down career and life updates is probably a good idea. 
            Especially so that I have a medium to express how I've been feeling. 
            <br><br>
            Jobs hunting is pretty exhausting lately; especially in a post-covid market. 
            Hopefully I'd land work where I can build data pipelines for large amounts of data. 
            But for now, all I can do is continue to do projects and just learn more tech skills people are using today. 
            And eventually once I've recovered from the burnout, then its back to applying for jobs.
            <br><br>
            At the beginning of the job hunt I was doing frontend work -which to be honest is pretty fun and I'm confident enough in my skills to work in that domain-
            but lately I've been pivoting to backend work because I feel like there's just so much room for improvement and innovations there. 
            I still appreciate the frontend learning experience though, because I wouldn't even be able to make web apps if never learn those skills. 
            <br><br>
            TL;DR - Burned out. So, I'm gonna teak a break and relax.
