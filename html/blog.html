            I think starting a blog to jot down career and life updates is probably a good idea. 
            Especially so that I have a medium to express how I've been feeling. 
            <br><br>
            Honestly, I've been pretty burnt out on applying for jobs lately; especially in a post-covid market. 
            But... I'm really hoping that in the future I can land one where I can work with large amounts of data and maybe around machine learning. 
            For now, all I can do is continue to do projects and just learn more tech skills people are using today, 
            and eventually once I've recovered from the burnout, then its back to applying for jobs.
            <br><br>
            At first I was doing frontend dev work, which to be honest is pretty fun and I'm confident enough in my skills to work in that domain,
            but I've been pivoting lately to backend/data-centric work because I feel like theres just so much room for improvement and innovations there. 
            I still appreciate the experience learning frontend though, because I wouldnt even be able to make webapps if I didn't learn those skills. 
            <br><br>
            TL;DR - Exhausted, taking a break, eventually return to job hunt!
